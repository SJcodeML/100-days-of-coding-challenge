// // Question 137: Implement a try-catch block to handle potential errors in a block of code.
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
// The code you provided demonstrates the use of a `try-catch` block to handle errors gracefully. Here's a breakdown of how it works:
// ```javascript
// // Demonstrates using a try-catch block to handle errors
// try {
//   // Intentionally cause an error
//   throw new Error("Something went wrong");
// } catch (error) {
//   console.log(error.message); // Logs the error message
// }
// // This code tries to execute a block that throws an error, and the catch block handles the error gracefully.
// ```
// 1. The `try` block contains the code that may potentially throw an error. In this case, it intentionally throws an `Error` object with the message "Something went wrong".
// 2. If an error occurs within the `try` block, the control flow moves to the `catch` block. The `catch` block accepts an `error` parameter, which represents the caught error.
// 3. Inside the `catch` block, you can handle the error gracefully. In this example, it logs the error message using `console.log(error.message)`.
// 4. If no error occurs within the `try` block, the `catch` block is skipped, and the program continues executing after the `try-catch` block.
// Overall, `try-catch` blocks are useful for handling errors in JavaScript code and preventing them from crashing the entire application. They allow you to gracefully handle exceptions and continue execution without interruption.
// In summary, this line of code is used to intentionally generate an error with a specific message ("Something went wrong") 
// at the point where it's executed. This can be useful for signaling exceptional conditions or handling unexpected situations in your code.
// Demonstrates using a try-catch block to handle errors
try {
    // Intentionally cause an error
    throw new Error("Something went wrong");
}
catch (error) {
    //console.log(error.message); // Logs the error message
}
// This code tries to execute a block that throws an error, and the catch block handles the error gracefully.
