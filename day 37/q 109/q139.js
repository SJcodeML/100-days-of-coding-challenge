// //Sure! Here are the uses of three reserved words in TypeScript:
// 1. **class**: Used to define a blueprint for creating objects. Classes encapsulate data for the object and define behavior for the object.
// 2. **const**: Used to declare a constant variable in TypeScript. Once a value is assigned to a constant, it cannot be reassigned or redeclared.
// 3. **delete**: Used to remove a property from an object. It can also be used to remove an element from an array.
